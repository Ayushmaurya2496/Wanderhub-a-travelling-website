WanderLust is my first full-stack web development project, inspired by my love for exploring and learning. It took me almost 6 months to understand different web components and technologies — from frontend frameworks to backend integration, database management, and user authentication.

This project represents not only my technical growth but also my dedication to building something meaningful from scratch. Every feature you see here has been a result of multiple trials, hours of debugging, and countless cups of chai! ☕
